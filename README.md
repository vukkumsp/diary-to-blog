# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Things to learn from working on this project

Of course, I'd be happy to help you learn ReactJS!

ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. Here are some key concepts to understand when learning ReactJS:

## Components: 
ReactJS is based on the concept of components, which are reusable building blocks for creating user interfaces. Components can be thought of as custom HTML tags that define what should be displayed on the screen.

## Virtual DOM: 
ReactJS uses a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. React updates the virtual DOM when changes are made, and then updates the actual DOM only where necessary. This approach makes updates faster and more efficient.

## JSX: 
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files. JSX makes it easy to create React components and render them to the DOM.

## State: 
React components can have state, which is an object that contains data that can change over time. When the state changes, React will automatically update the component to reflect the new state.

### To get started with ReactJS, you will need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can then follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and NPM on your computer.

2. Create a new React project using the Create React App command.

3. Start building your first React component. You can use JSX to define the component's structure and use state to manage its data.

4. Once you've built your component, you can render it to the DOM using ReactDOM.

5. You can then build more complex components and use React's props system to pass data between them.

6. Finally, you can add interactivity to your components by using event handlers and other React features.

There are many great resources available online for learning ReactJS, including the official React documentation and various online tutorials and courses. I recommend starting with a basic tutorial and gradually working your way up to more advanced topics. Good luck!
